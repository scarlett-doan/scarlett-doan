- 👩‍💼 I'm interested in both product business and technique so that's why my long term goal is to become a PO who has great responsibilities to make sure the quality of the products in both terms of business and usability as well as oversee technology trends to identify the better way to audit the product to release the best service for people.
- 👩‍💻 I have almost 5 years of experience in the global outsourcing companies as a Software QA Engineer with 2 years of automation testing experience. Most of the projects I have joined apply Agile/Scrum and Kanban models.
- ✍️​ I always keep learning and improving technical, and soft skills and use them to contribute to the quality of the products.
- 🌟 I love researching new technologies, and tools to improve the performance of testing parts.;
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help;
